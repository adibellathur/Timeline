Donald Trump has spent a good chunk of his presidency far away from the fly-infested White House — lately at a cottage on his resort in Bedminster, N.J., where he recently explained to fellow golfers that the “White House is a real dump,” according to Golf Magazine.

You may have heard this already — and that Trump denied making the remark.

“TOTALLY UNTRUE,” he wrote Wednesday, several hours before he once again evacuated the White House for Bedminster — at which point a renovation crew immediately began tearing the presidential residence apart.
